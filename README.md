# Bitcoin Close Value Prediction Using LSTM

This project aims to comprehensively understand and practically apply a Deep Learning algorithm known as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory).

The application of this study is centered around a Bitcoin dataset and some key financial concepts to construct and train the model.

The primary objective of this study is to gain insights into the workings of an LSTM neural network, its workflow, and to develop a simple yet flexible application using the model, while acknowledging its unique characteristics and limitations. The code is not intended to provide stock recommendations or facilitate trading based on its results; rather, its purpose is to analyze the functionality and efficacy of the model.
